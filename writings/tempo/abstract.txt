We present computer-aided composition experiments related
to the notions of polyrhythmic structures and variable
tempo curves. We propose a formal context and some
tools that enable the generation of complex polyrhythms
with continuously varying tempos integrated in compositional
processes and performance, implemented as algorithms
and user interfaces.
