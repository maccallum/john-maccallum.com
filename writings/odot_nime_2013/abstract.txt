This paper introduces "o.expr," an expression language for dynamic, object- and agent-oriented computation of gesture signal processing workflows using OSC bundles.  The use of o.expr is shown for a range of gesture processing tasks.  Aspects of o.expr, including statelessness and homoiconicity, simplify agile applications development and provide support for heterogeneous computational networks.
