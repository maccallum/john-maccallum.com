We present work on the ``o.io'' system, a suite of tools for hiding vendor-specific and protocol-specific details of con-trollers and actuators and for replacing diffuse documentation and heterogeneous ontologies with harmonized, situational schema carried along in real-time with gesture and actuator control values as Open Sound Control (OSC) bundles. We introduce useful general design patterns and object-oriented tools that support them. We conclude with details of support of two particular devices that illustrate the potential of ``o.io'', the QuNeo and Bluetooth LE heart rate monitors.
