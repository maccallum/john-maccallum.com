This paper addresses the problem that most electrophones and computer-based musical instruments are ephemera lasting long enough to signal academic and technical prowess. They rarely are used more than in a few musical performances. We offer a case study that suggests that longevity of use depends on stabilizing the interface and innovating the implementation to maintain the required stability of performance for players.
