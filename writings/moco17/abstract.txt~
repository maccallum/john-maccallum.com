In this article we discuss the ethical and aesthetic implications of
the appropriation of biomedical sensors in artistic practice. The
concept of cross-disciplinary appropriation is elaborated with reference
to Guattari's ethico-aesthetic paradigms, and Barad's metaphor
of diffraction as methodology. In reviewing existing artistic projects
with biosensors, we consider ways in which the recontextualization
of technologies, and likewise techniques, can both propagate and violate
disciplinary expectations and approaches. We propose that by
way of critical appropriations of biosensors in artistic practice-that
is to say, de- and re-contextualizations of biosensors that acknowledge
the shift of ecology and epistemology---artists have a vital role
to play in troubling reductive representations of bodies, and furthermore,
destabilizing the ethico-æsthetic boundaries of dierently
constituted disciplines.
