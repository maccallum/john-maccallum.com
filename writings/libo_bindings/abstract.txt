We present recent work on odot, a system that extends Open
Sound Control and facilitates the rapid and dynamic construction
of Message-Oriented Middleware providing an interoperability
layer for communication between applications.
Unlike traditional middleware systems, odot, when embedded
in a host environment, provides a node where computation
can take place, allowing middleware to take shape dynamically
as the needs of the system develop.
