We present a parametric method for the variable control of tempo with specification of shape and phase alignment co\
nstraints, and its implementation as a  graphical interface written in C for the Max/MSP environment. This tool aids in the construction and management of polyphonic streams of independent, fixed or smoothly-varying tempos suitable for live performance or computer-generated scores.  We also present a brief history of how polyphonic tempo manipulation has been used in context and compare our work with two recent projects to implement similar tools.
