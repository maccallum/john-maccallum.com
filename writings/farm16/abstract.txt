O.---odot---is a portable media programming framework based on
the OSC data encoding. It embeds a small expression language
which allows writing and executing programs in OSC structures. The
integration of programming and declarative functional descriptions
within data transfer protocols enables structured and expressive communication
in media systems: program snippets can be distributed
in OSC messages, which evaluate to further OSC messages in the
different communicating software. We present experiments using
this framework in the OpenMusic computer-aided composition environment,
and illustrate via case studies some advantages of such
integrated system.
