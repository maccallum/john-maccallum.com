We present two complementary approaches for the visualization and interaction of dimensionally reduced 
data sets using hybridization interfaces.  Our implementations privilege syncretic systems allowing 
one to explore combinations (hybrids) of disparate elements of a data set through their placement
in a 2-D space.  The first approach allows for the placement of data points anywhere on the plane
according to an anticipated performance strategy.  The contribution (weight) of each data point 
varies according to a power function of the distance from the control cursor.  The second approach
uses constrained vertex colored triangulations of manifolds with labels placed at the vertices of triangular tiles.  Weights are computed by barycentric projection of the control cursor position.
