We present a practice-based research project, which examines temporal relationships between physiological
processes with human movement and mediated environments. Ongoing research will provide a foundation for the
creation of performances in which real-time heart rate data from contemporary dancers is used to generate click
tracks for live musicians. The complex constructions of time in this project necessitate novel visualization
strategies throughout the research, development, creation, and production process, including: time domain
display of data with rich and facile interaction using bokeh; visualization of biometric data as a form of
biofeedback; and unique representations of time in music notation.
