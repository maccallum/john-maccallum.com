In this article we propose a biorelational framework for performance with biosensors, in
which interactions are not based on causality, control, and representation, but rather,
manifest through shared awareness and agency across multiple, fluid assemblies of self,
other and environment. The transdisciplinary scope of this study traces trajectories from
the performing and somatic arts into philosophy, biomedicine, cognitive science and
computer-human interaction. A brief survey of common approaches to interaction design
with biosensors will contextualize discussion of our current practice-based research and
creation project, 'Choreography and Composition of Internal Time'. In this project, we
are examining temporal relationships between physiological processes, such as heart rate
and breath, with rhythms in movement, music and mediated environments.
