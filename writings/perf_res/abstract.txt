<i>We exist in a universe of sound...and we can't stop listening...Sound evokes place not space. That is to say sound is where we locate ourselves...It is our greatest experience of intimacy.</i> (Sellars cited in Kay and LeBrecht 2009:iv)

We are interested in intimacy, in listening as intimacy. We are Peader Kirk, a theatre maker who has created a number of works under the rubric of 'sound as performance' and approaches listening to the body's interior as a sound world for the performative exploration. We are Teoma Naccarato and John MacCallum, collaborators in a long-term artistic research and creation project focused on the critical appropriation of biosensors in choreographic and compositional practice.

We came together at the <i>Conventions of Proximity in Art, Theatre and Performance Symbosium</i> at Birkbeck, University of London in May 2016, to co-facilitate a workshop on the theme of <i>Intimate Listening</i>.
