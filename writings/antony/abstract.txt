We present a re-realization of David Wessel's Antony
(1977). Antony was originally composed using a novel set of
additive synthesis techniques developed for the 4A and the
PDP 11/40. Those techniques continued to play a role
throughout Wessel's life as an improviser, and inspired
many of his students and colleagues. Our re-realization of
Antony involves using those same techniques to reinterpret
and perform the very piece that they were used to create.
