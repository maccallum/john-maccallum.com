Faced with the impossibility of concatenating, they utter sentences that are interrupted, exhausted, come to a standstill.  Even phrases they cannot formulate.  A repetitive rhythm, a monotonous
melody emerge and dominate the broken logical sequences, changing them into recurring, obsessive litanies.  Finally, when that frugal musicality becomes exhausted in its turn, or simply does not
succeed in becoming established on account of the pressure of silence, the melancholy person appears to stop cognizing as well as uttering, sinking into the blankness of asymbolia or the excess of
unorderable cognitive chaos.

---Julia Kristeva, <i>Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia.</i>
