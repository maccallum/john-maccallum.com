Limn consists of two pieces, one for electronics, and the other for flute and cello. Either piece may be played separately, or they may both be played simultaneously. If the electronics are played on their own, they should be di used using no fewer than 8 speakers, preferably in a medium-to-large reverberant space.
When the electronics are played together with the instrumental piece, the electronics should be di used using 2 small speakers placed very near to the two musicians. The instruments should not be amplified, and the electronics should be balanced with the instrumental parts striving for a feeling of intimacy.
